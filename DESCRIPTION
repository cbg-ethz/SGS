Title: Inference in Bayesian Networks
Description: Implementation of common inference algorithms for Bayesian networks. Allows for efficient exact and approximate inference that works both in low- and high-dimensional settings. Efficient marginalization is reached by splitting the calculation into sub-calculations of lower dimensionality. Implemented approximate inference algoti Gibbs sampling, loopy belief propagation and SubGroupSeparation. 
	Implemented exact inference methods: SubGroupSeparation (fastest), junction-tree algorithm, complete enumeration. 
	Implemented approximate inference methods: SubGroupSeparation (highest accuracy), loopy belief propagation, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.
