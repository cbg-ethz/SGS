\description{
Learn the structure (the directed acyclic graph) of a \code{\link{BN}} object according to a \code{\link{BNDataset}}.
}
\details{
We provide three algorithms in order to learn the structure of the network, that can be chosen with the \code{algo} parameter.
The first is the Silander-Myllym\"aki (\code{sm})
exact search-and-score algorithm, that performs a complete evaluation of the search space in order to discover
the best network; this algorithm may take a very long time, and can be inapplicable when discovering networks
with more than 25--30 nodes. Even for small networks, users are strongly encouraged to provide
meaningful parameters such as the layering of the nodes, or the maximum number of parents -- refer to the 
documentation in package manual for more details on the method parameters.

The second method is the constraint-based Max-Min Parents-and-Children (\code{mmpc}), that returns the skeleton of the network.
Given the possible presence of loops, due to the non-directionality of the edges discovered, no parameter learning
is possible using this algorithm. Also note that in the case of a very dense network and lots of obsevations, the statistical evaluation
of the search space may take a long time. Also for this algorithm there are parameters that may need to be tuned,
mainly the confidence threshold of the statistical pruning. Please refer to the rest of this documentation for their explanation.

The third algorithm is another heuristic, the Hill-Climbing (\code{hc}). It can start from the complete space of possibilities
(default) or from a reduced subset of possible edges, using the \code{cpc} argument.

The fourth algorithm (and the default one) is the Max-Min Hill-Climbing heuristic (\code{mmhc}), that performs a statistical
sieving of the search space followed by a greedy evaluation, by combining the MMPC and the HC algorithms.
It is considerably faster than the complete method, at the cost of a (likely)
lower quality. As for MMPC, the computational time depends on the density of the network, the number of observations and
the tuning of the parameters.

The fifth method is the Structural Expectation-Maximization (\code{sem}) algorithm,
for learning a network from a dataset with missing values. It iterates a sequence of Expectation-Maximization (in order to ``fill in''
the holes in the dataset) and structure learning from the guessed dataset, until convergence. The structure learning used inside SEM,
due to computational reasons, is MMHC. Convergence of SEM can be controlled with the parameters \code{struct.threshold}
and \code{param.threshold}, for the structure and the parameter convergence, respectively.

and \code{param.threshold}, for the structure and the parameter convergence, respectively.

Search-and-score methods also need a scoring function to compute an estimated measure of each configuration of nodes.
We provide three of the most popular scoring functions, \code{BDeu} (Bayesian-Dirichlet equivalent uniform, default),
\code{AIC} (Akaike Information Criterion) and \code{BIC} (Bayesian Information Criterion). The scoring function
can be chosen using the \code{scoring.func} parameter.

Structure learning sets the \code{dag} field of the \code{BN} under study, unless bootstrap or the \code{mmpc} algorithm
are employed. In these cases, given the possible presence of loops, the \code{wpdag} field is set.

In case of missing data, the default behaviour (with no other indication from the user)
is to learn the structure using \code{mmhc} starting from the raw dataset.
